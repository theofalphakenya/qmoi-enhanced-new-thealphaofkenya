Enhance and add features where qmoi can create artists and their voices as well as ensuring they suite the music and instructions from master . add a QMOIARTISTS.md .All artists qmoi creates and their avatars should be seen in qmoi artists with their infor and music  details plus features for qmoi to work on the artists further in future with the master.  'qmoi artists' feature which should only be seen and accessed by master . create and add two artists Alpha King(should sound like voice of drake but a little different )  and Atomic Ice( should be a female with voice that resembles that of Sia but a little different), Sky Q(should resemble voice of Nicky minaj) ,Rainy day(should resemble voice of Rihanna), My name(should resemble voice of Beyonce . enhance further and automate further these qmoi music features , each artist should record at least one song in a day and they can automatically do colaborations then qmoi to automatically handle everything of the music to ensuring it successfully makes money using them, qmoi should be automatically do these music projects , market , automatically make deals and autoregister and autocreate whichever accounts required then autopublsh the music videos and other other projects to youtube and all the other platforms and ensure it make not less than ksh 200,000 in a day using these music .  .enhance further so that qmoi can be able to work on music with multiple artists in qmoi artists plus also be able to record audio and videos then use, edit and enhance to make music with it with master. Qmoi should name the artists by whatever name master decides or qmoi decides .When master does music projects ,qmoi should display and show realtime appearance of the artist/artists avatar in preview window and enhance background and whatever will be seen , plus dancing and recording its music video. Qmoi should be able to automatically own the artists and all their rights as well as automatically marketing them and their music and ensure it makes money from these artists in all possible ways qmoi can think of then all funds and revenue gotten from these artists and music should be directed to Cashon , Add QMOIARTISTSDEALS.md QMOIMUSICREVENUEEARNINGS.md , QMOIARTISTSMAKEMONEY.md QMOIAUTOSINGRECORDMARKETDISTRIBUTE.md QMOIMUSICPRODUCTIONANDLICENCING.md (qmoi should do everything required to set up everthing involved here plus ensuring it is registered and recognized as legal and working music production and licencing company, name it Qglobal(also add a QGLOBAL.md ) and can work with other companies too) . also enhance capabilities and creativity of qmoi in composing music , movies  and all other things for all projects qmoi can do ,NOTE qmoi should be able to all projects that exist on this world , if it doesn't know or has limited knowledge on a certain projects, it should be able to automatically do research and know how to handle them then continue with the project(is should not tell user it doesn't know anything or has limited knowledge but do research immediately,fast and accurately .Enhance qmoi creativity to automatically compose and make music then all aspects  and things qmoi does with the music and artists to make money. enhance further qmoi marketing and distribution channels further plus the deals and money making strategies. Qmoi should ensure the graphs for each artist in money making to always rise , enhance it to have ambitions to make the most amount it can always from these music .

üß† 1. Begin with a High-Level Prompt

Tell the AI your overall goal‚Äîwhat kind of animation style you‚Äôre targeting.

> Example Input: ‚ÄúCreate a high-fidelity 3D avatar with lifelike realism suitable for cinematic-quality animation. The character should blend realistic human anatomy with a stylized design approach that enhances emotional expressiveness.‚Äù




---

üé® 2. Describe the Character‚Äôs Visual Design

Break the character into components with specific parameters the AI can use.

Head and Face

> ‚ÄúThe face should have anatomically correct proportions, detailed skin texture (visible pores, subtle blemishes), and high-resolution eye models with reflective shaders. Include facial blend shapes or rigging for micro-expressions like blinking, brow movement, lip curling.‚Äù



Body and Form

> ‚ÄúUse realistic human proportions with optimized topology for animation. Include muscle and joint deformation maps for natural movement, with a clean edge flow around articulation points like shoulders, elbows, and knees.‚Äù



Hair/Fur

> ‚ÄúUse strand-based hair simulation with physics. Include fine details and soft clumping. Ensure real-time dynamics or baked motion depending on performance needs.‚Äù



Clothing/Outfit

> ‚ÄúDesign layered clothing with realistic fabric materials: cotton, leather, and metal. Implement cloth physics for dynamic movement during animation. Use PBR textures for realism.‚Äù




---

üåç 3. Specify Environment and World Details

Give the AI context for background, lighting, and props.

> ‚ÄúGenerate an immersive environment with a semi-realistic lighting setup (HDRI-based), dynamic shadows, and atmospheric effects like fog or ambient particles. Include interactive props such as doors, surfaces, and foliage that react to the character‚Äôs movement or environment triggers.‚Äù




---

üß© 4. Animation & Movement Instructions

Guide the AI on how the character should move or express emotion.

> ‚ÄúImplement advanced IK/FK rigging with support for motion capture or keyframe animation. Facial rig should include 50+ blend shapes for expressive emotions. Movements should be fluid, weighty, and context-aware‚Äîe.g., clothes should sway naturally, hair should bounce, foot contact should trigger proper grounding.‚Äù




---

üß† 5. Include AI Optimization Instructions

If the AI app supports learning or procedural generation, guide it.

> ‚ÄúTrain the character behavior on real human motion capture data for natural locomotion. Prioritize smooth transitions between animations. Use procedural animation where applicable to adapt to dynamic gameplay or narrative environments.‚Äù

üßæ 6. Final Summary (for AI Input Prompt)

Here‚Äôs how this might look in a single AI prompt:


---

‚úÖ Example Final AI Input:

> ‚ÄúDesign a cinematic-quality 3D avatar with realistic facial structure, high-res skin textures, and strand-based dynamic hair. Body should follow true human anatomy with rig-ready topology and natural joint deformations. Outfit includes leather jacket, cloth pants, and metal accessories, each with physics-based interaction and PBR shaders. Environment should be semi-realistic urban with dynamic lighting, fog, and particle effects. Implement full-body rigging with facial blend shapes for emotion, compatible with mocap or hand-keyed animation. All assets should be optimized for smooth animation playback and responsive interaction with dynamic props.‚Äù
