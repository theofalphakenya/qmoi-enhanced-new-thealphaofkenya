Repository notes extracted from `qmoi-enhanced/doit.py`.

This file contains planning notes and long-form documentation that were
previously embedded inside a Python module. The original content has been
preserved here (trimmed) so the repository keeps the information while the
executable module is replaced with a small, syntactically-valid stub.

---

Excerpt (shortened):

The original file described steps to enhance the QM0I avatar system, model
card guidance for Hugging Face, pushing weights and tokenizer, inference API
integration, continuous monitoring, and deployment notes.

It also included TODOs for: EMPLOYEESUSERSENROLLED.md, QMOIEMPLOYEES.md,
QMOIAUTOOPPORTUNITIES.md and other documentation files. For the full original
content, see the commit history or TRIAGE_PLACEHOLDERS.md.

Notes:
- Moved to reduce syntax errors in Python scans.
- Replace the stub module with a real implementation and delete this file only
  after verifying no data loss is required.
Original content from `qmoi-enhanced/doit.py` extracted here.

This was mainly project planning and guidance; convert to docs as part of cleanup.
