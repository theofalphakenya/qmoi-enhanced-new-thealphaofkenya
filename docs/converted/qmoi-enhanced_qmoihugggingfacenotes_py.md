Webhooks
Webhooks are now publicly available!

Webhooks are a foundation for MLOps-related features. They allow you to listen for new changes on specific repos or to all repos belonging to particular set of users/organizations (not just your repos, but any repo).

You can use them to auto-convert models, build community bots, or build CI/CD for your models, datasets, and Spaces (and much more!).

The documentation for Webhooks is below – or you can also browse our guides showcasing a few possible use cases of Webhooks:

Fine-tune a new model whenever a dataset gets updated (Python)
Create a discussion bot on the Hub, using a LLM API (NodeJS)
Create metadata quality reports (Python)
and more to come…
