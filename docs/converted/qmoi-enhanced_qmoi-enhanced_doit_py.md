To enhance your model and improve its documentation, follow this plan:


---

‚úÖ 1. Complete the Model Card (Documentation)

On Hugging Face, the model card is critical ‚Äî it's the first thing users see and helps them understand your model.

Add these sections to the Model Card:

You can click ‚ÄúEdit Model Card‚Äù on the Hugging Face UI and use Markdown. Add the following structure:

# Model Name: qmoi

## Model Description
Explain what your model does. Is it a text classifier? Image generator? Be specific.

Example:
> This is a transformer-based text classification model trained to detect sentiment in movie reviews (positive/negative/neutral). Fine-tuned from `bert-base-uncased`.

## Intended Use
- Who should use this model?
- What use-cases is it meant for?
- What is it **not** suitable for?

## Training Data
- Where did you get the training data?
- Any biases, limitations, or caveats?

## Training Procedure
- Framework used (e.g., PyTorch, Transformers)
- Training duration, hardware, epochs, batch size
- Evaluation metrics

## Example Code
Provide quick-start code:

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSequenceClassification
import torch

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("alphaqmoi/qmoi")
model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("alphaqmoi/qmoi")

inputs = tokenizer("This movie was amazing!", return_tensors="pt")
outputs = model(**inputs)

Limitations

Known issues, biases, or performance drops.


License

Apache 2.0 (already set by you)

---

## ‚úÖ 2. **Push Weights and Tokenizer**

If not already uploaded:

### Install CLI (once)
```bash
pip install -U huggingface_hub[cli]

Log in with your token:

huggingface-cli login

Push model:

huggingface-cli upload alphaqmoi/qmoi .

You can upload .bin, .pt, or .safetensors files along with config and tokenizer files.


---

‚úÖ 3. Add Inference API Support (Optional but Useful)

If you want to enable web inference:

1. Convert your model to a format supported by the ü§ó Inference API (transformers or onnx, etc.).


2. Set up config.json, tokenizer_config.json, etc.


3. Enable ‚ÄúThis model can be loaded with from_pretrained‚Äù by pushing these files.



Then users can try the model in-browser.


---

‚úÖ 4. Add Tags, Tasks, Language Info

Click ‚ÄúEdit model card‚Äù and fill:

Tags (e.g., text-classification, transformers)

Language (e.g., en)

Task (e.g., Sentiment Analysis)


These make your model discoverable.


---

‚úÖ 5. Evaluation Metrics (Optional but Professional)

Use evaluate or datasets libraries to compute metrics like accuracy, F1, etc., and post them in your card.

from evaluate import load
accuracy = load("accuracy")
results = accuracy.compute(predictions=preds, references=labels)
print(results)

Include a table in your card:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Accuracy | 92.3% |
| F1-Score | 91.7% |


---

‚úÖ 6. (Optional) Convert Private to Public

Once you're ready to share with the world, change visibility from private to public on Hugging Face.


---

‚úÖ 7. Useful Resources

Transformers Docs

Enhance further so that all the models are running and qmoi is being updated and used always even now. you have a model on Hugging Face, and you want to ensure it's running and that you're using it properly, here‚Äôs a checklist of steps to follow, depending on whether it's a hosted model, your own model, or one you're using in your app (e.g., for inference):


---

‚úÖ 1. Confirm the Model is Live on Hugging Face

Make sure your model is properly uploaded and published:

Go to: https://huggingface.co/your-username/your-model-name

Check that:

The README and inference widget load correctly.

Model files (config.json, pytorch_model.bin, tokenizer, etc.) are present.

The model has the correct license, tags, and visibility (public/private).

If you‚Äôve enabled the ‚ÄúUse in Transformers‚Äù widget, try it out there.




---

üß™ 2. Test the Model Using the Inference Widget

On the model's page, you can enter [PRODUCTION IMPLEMENTATION REQUIRED] input in the provided inference widget.

This is especially useful for text-classification, text-generation, image-classification, etc.

If it works here, the model is accessible via the API.



---

üíª 3. Use It Programmatically with the Transformers Library

üì¶ Install Required Packages:

pip install transformers

üß† Load the Model in Code:

from transformers import pipeline

# Example for text generation:
generator = pipeline("text-generation", model="your-username/your-model-name")
result = generator("Once upon a time", max_length=50)
print(result)

Change the task type ("text-generation", "text-classification", etc.) based on your model.



---

üåê 4. Use the Hugging Face Inference API (No Hosting Required)

You can run the model via Hugging Face's hosted inference API.

üîë You‚Äôll need your Hugging Face API key:

Get it from: https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens


üîÅ Example API Call (Python requests):

import requests

API_URL = "https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/your-username/your-model-name"
headers = {"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_HF_API_TOKEN"}

response = requests.post(API_URL, headers=headers, json={"inputs": "Hello world"})
print(response.json())


---

üöÄ 5. Deploy to Inference Endpoints (Optional)

If you want production-grade performance, deploy your model as an Inference Endpoint:

On the model page, click ‚ÄúDeploy‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúInference Endpoints‚Äù

Choose the cloud provider (AWS, Azure, etc.)

This gives you:

Dedicated scalability

Private inference

Guaranteed uptime




---

üß† 6. Monitor & Test Continuously

Use logging or dashboards (like Hugging Face Spaces or external tools) to track:

Inference speed

Failure rates

Input/output validity


Periodically test the model to ensure it's serving correct results.



---

üß© Optional Enhancements

Wrap your model in a Streamlit/Gradio UI and host it in a Hugging Face Space.

Fine-tune or retrain it regularly to keep it up to date.

Version your model using tags or branches (v1, v2, etc.)
